The project you've described is a student management system responsible for storing information about students, allowing operations such as adding, deleting, and updating student records. It's connected to a MySQL database and implemented using Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring REST, Lombok for boilerplate code reduction, and validation for data integrity. Here's a brief overview of its functionalities:

Store Student Information:

The system stores student information such as first name, last name, and email address in a MySQL database.
Each student record contains these details, ensuring comprehensive data storage for each student.
Add Students:

Users can add new student records to the system by providing the required information (first name, last name, email).
Upon submission, the system validates the input data and adds the new student record to the database.
Delete Students:

Users can delete existing student records from the system if they are no longer needed.
Upon confirmation, the system removes the selected student record from the database.
Update Students:

Users can update existing student records with new information, such as modifying the first name, last name, or email address.
The system validates the updated data and applies the changes to the corresponding student record in the database.
Connectivity with MySQL Database:

The system is connected to a MySQL database, allowing seamless storage and retrieval of student information.
Spring Data provides the necessary abstraction to interact with the database, simplifying data access operations.
Backend Implementation with Spring MVC and Spring REST:

Spring MVC handles the backend architecture, facilitating the development of RESTful APIs for student management functionalities.
Spring REST enables the creation of RESTful web services, allowing clients to interact with the system's endpoints to perform CRUD operations on student records.
Frontend Implementation with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap:

The frontend interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, providing a user-friendly and responsive layout for interacting with the student management system.
